# boringR

R is a powerful statistical programming language, with a strong ability for data visualization.  
This makes it possible for me to do some boring things with it. See the following description.

### 3D_HWE
I am sure that any biology major is familiar with the genotype frequency distribution for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium when there are only two alleles.  
This file, 3D_HWE, shows what the genotype distribution for HWE looks like when there are three alleles.

### CorlorfulCircle
This file makes colorful lines within a circle, with several parameters that you can customize.
